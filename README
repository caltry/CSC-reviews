This is a collection of practice exams for Freshman level Computer Science
exams at RIT. 

== Building
To build the PDFs, you'll need LaTeX, TeXlive-extra, graphviz and PGF/Tikz
installed. You can generate the PDFs by executing `make'.

== Adding Questions
To add a question to an existing exam, write it up as a standard question in
the enumerate environment. Place the solution to the question in an `answer'
environment:

    \item What's the most exciting feature in Java?
        \begin{answer}
        Trick question: there's nothing exciting about Java.
        \end{answer}

The answer environment is set up so that it /should/ provide enough room for
the students to write in their answers. You can tailor how much space is given
with \vspace{}.

== Setting up a new exam
There are a few important things that you need to do when setting up a new
exam:
    1. Create the answer file, which defines \isAnswerKey and imports the exam.
    2. Create the regular exam file, with a prelude that defines the answer
       environment.

Your best bet is to look for commit messages that mention setting up the
'skeleton' for an exam for an idea of the minimal setup needed.
